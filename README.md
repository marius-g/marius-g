I'm Marius, I work at [Dekode](https://dekode.no/) as a senior advisor. More at [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariusgranholt/).

I specialize in rather large web projects for NGOs with a focus on fundraising, engagement, and organization.

If you would like to work with us, feel free to reach out at hei@dekode.no :speech_balloon:. 

We're always looking for WordPress developers based in Europe, [please let us know](https://career.dekode.no/open-application) if you're up for a virtual coffee :star_struck:.
